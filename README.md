# ML_Python
Python short tutorials of the most common Machine Learning algorithms

This project is designed to be a quick guid to use some of the most common ML algorithms in Python. It mainly uses Scikit_learn library to implement fully functioning models on small data sets. 

The project has 3 categories: 
  1- Regression 
    * Linear Regression (TBA)
    * Multiple Regression (TBA)
    * Polynomial Regression (TBA)
    * Support Vector Regression (SVR) (TBA)
    * Decision Tree Regression (TBA)
    * Random Forest Regression (TBA)
    
  2- Classification
    * Linear Classification (TBA)
    * K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) (TBA)
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM) (TBA)
    * Kernel SVM (TBA)
    * Naive Bayes (TBA)
    * Decision Tree Classification (TBA)
    * Random Forest Classification (TBA)
  
  3- Clustering
    * K-means Clustering (TBA)
    * Hierarchical Clustering (TBA)
    
    
** Notes:
  - The data sets used are small and designed to demonstrate the idea behind the algorithm. The code should perform similarly when applied on bigger datasets.
  - Each algorithm code is written to run by itself.
  - Each algorithm contains a short description, code, images of graphic results
